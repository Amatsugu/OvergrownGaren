  displayName: Rose of Damocles
  description: If botany was a trading card game, Rose of Damocles would be a holographic
    Rose. How lucky of me! Shopkeeper keeps all of his exceptional seeds to me. He
    seems to get less customers day by day though. Shop only gets more desolate by
    the day. My guess would be that his illness prevents him from working properly.
    Poor guy gives all his attention to me so I will have to make sure that this
    Rose of Damocles grows like a king.
