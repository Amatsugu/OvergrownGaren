  displayName: Blinding Light At The End Of The Tunnel
  description: So pristine, so untouched. As I get closer to it my flesh reveals
    it's weakness. As I leave my shell, the Pulsar shines it's light into my very
    being. It is mine and it will stay that way until the light embraces me with
    all it's warmth. There is no end, there is no flesh, only dreams.
