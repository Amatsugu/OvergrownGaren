  description: I have been watching it all day. It rose from the soil like a corpse
    come alive. It looks like two creatures hugging each other. It also has roots
    reaching far into the floor, rapidly expanding. This...This can't be happening.
    I must be losing my mind. Is THIS the road to greatness?!... Or is it the prize
    of my ambition?
