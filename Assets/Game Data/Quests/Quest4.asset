  displayName: What Does The Magnolia Dream?
  description: "Magnolia is a flower of passion. Other plants I would describe as
    beautiful but Magnolia? No no no.... Magnolia is innocent. If I get to be a flower
    in another life and I get to choose which one I will turn into, Magnolia is my
    absolute choice. I wonder though, what does su\u0131ch innocence dream of? Ambition
    is corrosive and every dream is an ambition. What is better, to be the Magnolia
    or the Datura?"
