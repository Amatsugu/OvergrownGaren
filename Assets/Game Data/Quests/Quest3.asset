  description: When I was little the sight of a cactus would send fear into my heart.
    I had a terrible phobia of needles and as a kid I saw these Cactuses as impenetrable
    fortresses covered to the brim with needles. Today will be the day that I become
    a loving parent of a beautiful cactus! Shopkeeper said something about this specific
    type of cactus being illegal but of course it's illegal! Look at how cute it
    is!
